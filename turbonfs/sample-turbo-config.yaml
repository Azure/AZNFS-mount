#
# Consistency config.
# This controls the consistency level desired wrt updates from other clients.
# Following values are supported (from lowest to highest consistency):
# - solowriter
#   Use this when this fuse client is the only one accessing the share or all
#   other clients have mounted the share readonly, and hence it's guaranteed that
#   file/dirs cannot be updated outside our knowledge. This implies we can cache
#   attributes and data indefinitely and local changes will correctly update the
#   caches.
#   actimeo config will be ignored and set to "infinite" value.
#   Beware, if you wrongly choose this when there are other clients actually
#   making changes to the share (creating/deleting files/dirs) those changes may
#   not reflect for indefinitely long period.
#
# - standardnfs
#   Use this to get the same consistency as standard NFS, which is close-to-open
#   consistency with fresh attributes queried every actimeo period. actimeo
#   config will be honoured.
#   Files/directories are assumed to not have changed till actimeo after which
#   we make a GETATTR call to query the attributes based on which we decide if
#   the file/dir cache needs to be invalidated.
#   Hence any changes done by other clients will be reflected no later than
#   actimeo period.
#   Other non-NFS protocol clients may not see changes to files made by this
#   fuse client till the file is closed.
#
# - azurempa (Multi Protocol Access)
#   This is same as "standard" with one difference - non-NFS protocol clients
#   will see changes to files made by this fuse client more promptly.
#   Use this if you want to access files updated by this client, from other
#   non-NFS protocols.
#
consistency: solowriter

#
# Misc options
# fuse_* config variables control some fuse configurable value.
# fuse_max_threads has the same effect as fuse cmdline option "-o max_threads=".
# fuse_max_idle_threads has the same effect as fuse cmdline option "-o max_idle_threads=".
# Value of -1 for these imply "use fuse defaults". Fuse defaults must be fine for most cases.

#
# Cache config
#
# We cache the following:
# - file/dir attributes
# - lookup results
# - readdir data
# - file data
#
# attributes are cached in the kernel and/or user and can be controlled by the
# following mount options:
# - acregmin/acregmax
# - acdirmin/acdirmax
# - actimeo
# - lookupcache
#
# Attribute caching can be effectively disabled by setting actimeo to 0.
#
# Readdir data can be cached in the kernel and/or user caches.
# It can be controlled using cache.readdir.* config.
#
# File data can be cached in the kernel and/or user caches. User cache can be
# memory and/or file backed.
# Memory backed caches are controlled using cache.data.* configs, while
# file backed cache are controlled using filecache.* configs.
#
# Readahead is automatically scaled (up and down) based on the available cache
# and whether there are ongoing writes competing for the cache. readahead_kb
# is the initial value which is the scaled appropriately. It can be set to 0
# for disabling readaheads completely.
# For most cases you don't need to specify readahead_kb explicitly.
