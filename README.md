# AZNFS Mount Helper

> **Mount helper program for correctly handling endpoint IP address changes for Azure Blob NFS mounts.**

Azure Blob NFS is a highly available clustered NFSv3 server for providing NFSv3 access to Azure Blobs. To maintain availability
in case of infrequent-but-likely events like hardware failures, hardware decommissioning, etc, the endpoint IP of the Azure Blob
NFS endpoint may change. This change in IP is mostly transparent to applications because the DNS records are updated such that the
Azure Blob NFS FQDN always resolves to the updated IP. This works fine for new mounts as they will automatically connect to the new IP,
but this change in IP is not handled by Linux NFS client for already mounted shares, as it only resolves the IP at the time of mount
and any change in the server IP after mount will cause it to indefinitely attempt reconnect to the old IP. Also NFSv3 protocol doesn't
provide a way for server to convey such change in IP to the clients. This means that this change in IP has to be detected by a userspace
process and conveyed to the kernel through some supported interface. Using a mount helper is a supported way in Linux to do "something
extra" during a mount, hence this AZNFS mount helper is needed so that Linux NFS clients can reliably access Azure Blob NFS shares even
when their IP changes. Current version of this mount helper uses iptables DNAT functionality to map a stable proxy IP
which is mounted by the NFS client to the correct Blob NFS endpoint IP. This may change in future versions.

User has to install AZNFS package and mount the NFSv3 share using `-t aznfs` flag.  This package will run a background job called
**aznfswatchdog** to detect change in endpoint IP address for the mounted shares. If there will be any change in endpoint IP,
aznfswatchdog will update the DNAT rules appropriately.

This package picks a free private IP which is not in use by user's machine and mount the NFSv3 share using that IP and
create a DNAT rule to route the traffic from the chosen private IP to original endpoint IP.

## Supported Distros

AZNFS is supported on following Linux distros:

- Ubuntu
- RedHat
- Rocky
- SUSE
- Centos


## Install Instructions

- Run the following command to download and install **AZNFS**:
	```
	wget -O - -q https://github.com/Azure/AZNFS-mount/releases/latest/download/aznfs_install.sh | bash
	```
	It will install the aznfs mount helper program and the aznfswatchdog service.


## Usage Instructions

- Mount the Azure Blob NFS share using following command:
	```
	sudo mount -t aznfs -o vers=3 <account-name>.blob.core.windows.net:/<account-name>/<container-name> /mountpoint
	```
- Logs generated from AZNFS will be in `/opt/microsoft/aznfs/aznfs.log`.

## Implementation Details

This version of **AZNFS** mount helper uses iptables DNAT rules to forward NFS traffic directed to a local proxy IP
endpoint to actual Azure Blob NFS endpoint. It sets up a local IP endpoint which is used by the NFS client to
mount. A free local IP address is picked from the following range of private IP addresses in the given order:
  ```
  10.161.100.100 - 10.161.254.254
  192.168.100.100 - 192.168.254.254
  172.16.100.100 - 172.16.254.254
  ```

It will try its best to pick an IP address which is not in use but in case the free IP selection clashes with any
of client machines IP addresses, the `AZNFS_IP_PREFIXES` environment variable can be used to override the default IP range.
IP prefixes with either 2 or 3 octets can be set `f.e. 10.100 10.100.100 172.16 172.16.100 192.168 192.168.100`.
  ```
  export AZNFS_IP_PREFIXES="172.16 10.161"
  ```
  This will pick the IP addresses in the range `172.16.100.100 - 172.16.254.254` and `10.161.100.100 - 10.161.254.254`.

It starts a systemd service named **aznfswatchdog** which monitors the change in IP address for all the mounted Azure
Blob NFS shares. If it detects a change in endpoint IP, aznfswatchdog will update the iptables DNAT rule and NFS
traffic will be forwarded to new endpoint IP.

## Limitations

- Lazy unmount doesn't work as expected. Lazy unmount allows a share to be unmounted even if it's in use by some application and the way it works is that kernel detaches the mounted filesystem from the file hierarchy and performs other cleanup lazily when the filesystem is not busy anymore. This means applications which have files opened on the filesystem can continue to access the files using the already opened fds but no new fds can be opened. Since aznfswatchdog deletes the DNAT rule as soon as it detects that a mountpoint is no longer present, applications accessing the files using the fds already opened will not work since NFS requests will not make it to the Blob NFS server.
Unmount cleanup can be disabled by setting the env variable `AZNFS_SKIP_UNMOUNT_CLEANUP` to 1 and restarting the
aznfswatchdog service.
- Writing to the same file from different AZNFS mounts may result in reduced performance. This behaviour is not specific to the mount helper but a general behaviour of Blob NFS. Reading the same file from from different AZNFS mounts on the other hand does not have this limitation.


## TroubleShoot

- Check the status of aznfswatchdog service using `systemctl status aznfswatchdog`. If the service is not active, start
  it using `systemctl start aznfswatchdog`.
- Enable verbose logs to console by setting `AZNFS_VERBOSE` env variable with `export AZNFS_VERBOSE=1`.
- Provide the IP prefix in the range which is not in use by the machine by setting `AZNFS_IP_PREFIXES` env variable.
- If the problem is with assigning local private IP, set `AZNFS_PING_LOCAL_IP_BEFORE_USE` env variable to 1 using
  `export AZNFS_PING_LOCAL_IP_BEFORE_USE=1`.
